# On Elastic Geodesic Grids and Their Planar to Spatial Deployment #
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.00201.pdf

This paper describes how elastic geodesic grids can approximate a target surface and provides a mathematical proof of their computational algorithm which decides the design of the 2D planar deployment. The paper further describes the limitations to elastic geodesic grids and what is needed in order create a 2D to 3D structure.

Basically a textbook on general auxetics. He most commonly uses the rectangular cell and includes some "real-life" applications.
