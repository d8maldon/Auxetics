This code takes in a given 3D object and restructures the 3D object to a 2D surface. 
The example/sample structure is a small curved structure that resembles like an
upside down boat.

I tried using another 3D object, like the half dome and the code does not work.
Returns an error that the object is not on the ground. If this is a possible
avenue that someone would like to explore it is recommended to email the authors
of the following paper that is associated with this code.
